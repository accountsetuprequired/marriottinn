You're a little bitch livin' on the West side
In a shitty yacht, water blue and i dont mind
At night
See no tears run down my eyes (Run down my eyes)
Oh, these snaps they on d time 
Oh, these texts they bring me life (Bring me life)
Oh, your friends oh your friends

You're a little bitch livinâ€™ on the West side
Pushing up c's so you live your best liiiiiife (liiife)
No more texts and no more lies
I tell myself to sleep at night
Oh, these snaps, ay
Oh, these texts, ay
[Lil Bentley:]
She's a hoe type, never pull up on time
Lookin' in the mirror, all that makeup is a crime, crime
All this pain I'll never let show (Oh)
You don't deserve nothing although
Never know (Know, know), know
Never know, know (Know, know, know)
Handsome young man, never worried 'bout time (Yeah)
Flexin' on the 'net (No, no)
It's the same offline (Offline), offline (Offline)
What happened where'd my friend go?
You watching my every move (Every move)
Every move, every move (Every move), every move
                                           </div>
